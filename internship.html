<h2>Ask Suppression Tool for Activism and Pre-Release Products</h2>
<h4>Amazon.com, Seattle (May - Aug 2017)</h4>
<p><i>Worked with Ask team which owns the Question and Answers feature in Amazon.com. Ask helps millions of Amazon customers get the answers they need to make informed buying decisions. Some products on Amazon occasionally 
invite controversy. To protect customers, Amazon will temporarily suppress the posting of reviews, questions, answers and comments for controversial items. Also  some pre-release items need to suppress Q and A due to 
speculation. My project was mainly migration of suppression process from config file to their internal hierarchical database management system. The development is in Java.
</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p> Designed and implemented the Ask suppression tool for activism and pre-release products. Used an internal hierarchical database management system as a config store, to eliminate the code-build-deploy cycle thus 
making the process faster </p>
</li>
<li><p> Implemented a read-only mode for the Ask widget to ensure that legitimate customers don’t lose out on helpful answers during the suppression period. Created a self-service UI with fine-grained permission 
controls to add/edit values</p>
</li>
<li><p> Earlier the whole process of suppressing a widget and resolving a bug would take approximately 7-8 hours but with this tool, I was able to successfully achieve this in 5 mins. Was offered a full-time position 
after completion of internship</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project aimed at Analysing, Parsing of travel logs and Data visualization in the form of graphs and charts </h2>
