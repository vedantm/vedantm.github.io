<h1>Selected Projects</h1>
</div>
<h3>Effective Record Mapping in Synopsis for Apache Spark for Fast Data Retrieval</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Database System (Aug - Dec 2016)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Created a multi-layer synopsis, which acted as an abstract layer over a set of records, to prune off the unrequired records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tested observed and verified that the efficiency of synopsis increases with increase in number of records</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>Lexical, syntax, semantic analysis followed by intermediate code generation and final code generation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Augmenting PintOS operating system</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Operating Systems (Jul - Nov, 2012)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented and tested message queues, threads, processes, multiprogramming, scheduling policies, virtual &amp;
shared memory management and file-system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyzed and implemented different system calls, scheduling algorithms and synchronization algorithms</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android Application for Hindi Gesture Based Writing </h3>
<p><i>B.Tech Project (Jan - Apr 2014)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Built an Android application which processes user’s drawing gestures and predicts possible Hindi characters based on them</p>
</li>
<li><p>Character set implemented: constants, vowels, matras and numerals. User could also correct wrongly predicted word</p>
</li>
<li><p>Application trains itself according to user. Threshold score for each character is calculated based on a heuristic algorithm</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dictionary based prediction is implemented to predict three possibilities of word that user tries to write</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Build Hindi and Bangla OCR System for Crowd Sourcing </h3>
<p><i>B.Tech Project (Aug - Nov 2013)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented a crowd sourcing system that would take an image and perform OCR on it. User could also edit the output text</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyzed and summarized the existing OCR systems for Hindi and Bangla Language for their efficiency and robustness</p>
</li>
<li><p>Analyzed performance for Tesseract (Google OCR system) based on correctness of word and character</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Email Client in Python</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Computer Networks (Jul - Nov, 2012)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Implemented a desktop email client in python with basic client functionalities and a Graphic User Interface</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supported for multiple accounts for many users; Supported IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocols for retrieving and
sending mails, respectively; Supported offline and online mode depending upon internet connectivity</p>
</li>
</ul>	
<h3>Taxi Pooling Application</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Software Engineering (Aug - Nov, 2013)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Developed an android application which allows users to find their partners for sharing their trips with other people</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed an efficient database optimizing it such that queries and data retrieval take minimum amount of time</p>
</li>
<li><p>The application has various features including searching existing trips, creating a new trip and getting notified whenever another user requests to join a trip. User can either accept or reject the request</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Parsing Natural Scene Images using Recursive Neural Network(RNN)</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Artificial Intelligence (Jul - April, 2013)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Oversegmented an image into super-pixels using Mean Shift Algorithm based on similarity of the neighboring pixels</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extracted different features (like color ,shape feature) from the various segments and mapped it to semantic space</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implemented Recursive Neural Network to merge different super-pixels so as to output different segments</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Library Management System</h3>
<p><i>Course Project in Database Systems (Mar - April, 2013)</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Developed an application of library management system with features of searching, requesting and reissuing of book</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed E-R model for students and items sharing database and implemented in MySQL. Model was normalized to 3NF</p>
</li>
<li><p>The application has various levels of hierarchy with various permissions to a user in a specific hierarchy</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Interpreter for Oz</h3>
